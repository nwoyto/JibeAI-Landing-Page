# Jibe AI

Jibe AI is a personal assistant designed for busy professionals with demanding lives at work and at home. It listens passively, understands what matters, and helps you act—without the friction of typing, planning, or remembering.

By capturing conversations through ambient voice input and turning them into organized, actionable tasks, Jibe AI gives users a simple, elegant way to stay ahead of everything life throws at them.

### Vision

Jibe AI is more than a productivity tool. It is the first step toward a fully agentic personal operating system.

Our long-term goal is to create an assistant that:

- Listens to and understands your day in real time  
- Extracts and prioritizes what matters without prompts  
- Proactively suggests next steps, reminders, or follow-ups  
- Connects to your ecosystem to take action—on your behalf  

We believe the future isn’t about managing your life manually.  
It’s about having the right agent do it for you.
